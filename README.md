ResearchKit Framework
===========

The *ResearchKit™ framework* is an open source software framework that makes it easy to create apps
for medical research or for other research projects.

Use Cases
===========

A task in the *ResearchKit framework* contains a set of steps to present to a user. Everything,
whether it’s a *survey*, the *consent process*, or *active tasks*, is represented as a task that can
be presented with a task view controller.

Surveys
-------

The *ResearchKit framework* provides a pre-built user interface for surveys, which can be presented
modally on an *iPhone*, *iPod Touch*, or *iPad*. See
 *[Creating Surveys](http://researchkit.org/docs/docs/Survey/CreatingSurveys.html)* for more
 information.


Consent
----------------

The *ResearchKit framework* provides visual consent templates that you can customize to explain the
details of your research study and obtain a signature if needed.
See *[Obtaining Consent](http://researchkit.org/docs/docs/InformedConsent/InformedConsent.html)* for
more information.


Active Tasks
------------

Some studies may need data beyond survey questions or the passive data collection capabilities
available through use of the *HealthKit* and *CoreMotion* APIs if you are programming for *iOS*.
*ResearchKit*'s active tasks invite users to perform activities under semi-controlled conditions,
while *iPhone* sensors actively collect data. See
*[Active Tasks](http://researchkit.org/docs/docs/ActiveTasks/ActiveTasks.html)* for more
information.

Charts
------------
*ResearchKit* includes a *Charts module*. It features three chart types: a *pie chart* (`ORKPieChartView`), a *line graph chart* (`ORKLineGraphChartView`), and a *discrete graph chart* (`ORKDiscreteGraphChartView`).

The views in the *Charts module* can be used independently of the rest of *ResearchKit*. They don't automatically connect with any other part of *ResearchKit*: the developer has to supply the data to be displayed through the views' `dataSources`, which allows for maximum flexibility.

===============


Requirements
------------

The primary *ResearchKit framework* codebase supports *iOS* and requires *Xcode 8.0* or newer. The
*ResearchKit framework* has a *Base SDK* version of *8.0*, meaning that apps using the *ResearchKit
framework* can run on devices with *iOS 8.0* or newer.


Installation
------------

The latest stable version of *ResearchKit framework* can be cloned with

```
git clone -b stable https://github.com/ResearchKit/ResearchKit.git
```

Or, for the latest changes, use the `master` branch:

```
git clone https://github.com/ResearchKit/ResearchKit.git
```

Building
--------

Build the *ResearchKit framework* by opening `ResearchKit.xcodeproj` and running the `ResearchKit`
framework target. Optionally, run the unit tests too.


Adding the ResearchKit framework to your App
------------------------------

This walk-through shows how to embed the *ResearchKit framework* in your app as a dynamic framework,
and present a simple task view controller.

### 1. Add the ResearchKit framework to Your Project

To get started, drag `ResearchKit.xcodeproj` from your checkout into your *iOS* app project
in *Xcode*:

<figure>
  <img src="../../wiki/AddingResearchKitXcode.png" alt="Adding the ResearchKit framework to your
   project" align="middle"/>
</figure>
</center>

Then, embed the *ResearchKit framework* as a dynamic framework in your app, by adding it to the
*Embedded Binaries* section of the *General* pane for your target as shown in the figure below.

   Embedded Binaries" align="middle"/>
   <figcaption><center>Adding the ResearchKit framework to Embedded Binaries</center></figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

Note: You can also import *ResearchKit* into your project using a
 [dependency manager](./docs-standalone/dependency-management.md) such as *CocoaPods* or *Carthage*.

### 2. Create a Step

In this walk-through, we will use the *ResearchKit framework* to modally present a simple
 single-step task showing a single instruction.

Create a step for your task by adding some code, perhaps in `viewDidAppear:` of an existing view
controller. To keep things simple, we'll use an instruction step (`ORKInstructionStep`) and name
the step `myStep`.

*Objective-C*

```objc
ORKInstructionStep *myStep =
  [[ORKInstructionStep alloc] initWithIdentifier:@"intro"];
myStep.title = @"Welcome to ResearchKit";
```

*Swift*

```swift
let myStep = ORKInstructionStep(identifier: "intro")
myStep.title = "Welcome to ResearchKit"
```

### 3. Create a Task

Use the ordered task class (`ORKOrderedTask`) to create a task that contains `myStep`. An ordered
task is just a task where the order and selection of later steps does not depend on the results of
earlier ones. Name your task `task` and initialize it with `myStep`.

*Objective-C*

```objc
ORKOrderedTask *task =
  [[ORKOrderedTask alloc] initWithIdentifier:@"task" steps:@[myStep]];
```

*Swift*

```swift
let task = ORKOrderedTask(identifier: "task", steps: [myStep])
```

### 4. Present the Task

Create a task view controller (`ORKTaskViewController`) and initialize it with your `task`. A task
view controller manages a task and collects the results of each step. In this case, your task view
controller simply displays your instruction step.

*Objective-C*

```objc
ORKTaskViewController *taskViewController =
  [[ORKTaskViewController alloc] initWithTask:task taskRunUUID:nil];
taskViewController.delegate = self;
[self presentViewController:taskViewController animated:YES completion:nil];
```

*Swift*

```swift
let taskViewController = ORKTaskViewController(task: task, taskRunUUID: nil)
taskViewController.delegate = self
presentViewController(taskViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

The above snippet assumes that your class implements the `ORKTaskViewControllerDelegate` protocol.
This has just one required method, which you must implement in order to handle the completion of
 the task:

*Objective-C*

```objc
- (void)taskViewController:(ORKTaskViewController *)taskViewController
       didFinishWithReason:(ORKTaskViewControllerFinishReason)reason
                     error:(NSError *)error {

    ORKTaskResult *taskResult = [taskViewController result];
    // You could do something with the result here.

    // Then, dismiss the task view controller.
    [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
}
```

*Swift*

```swift
func taskViewController(taskViewController: ORKTaskViewController,
                didFinishWithReason reason: ORKTaskViewControllerFinishReason,
                                     error: NSError?) {
  let taskResult = taskViewController.result
  // You could do something with the result here.

  // Then, dismiss the task view controller.
  dismissViewControllerAnimated(true, completion: nil)
}
```


If you now run your app, you should see your first *ResearchKit framework* instruction step:

What else can the ResearchKit framework do?
-----------------------------

The *ResearchKit* [`ORKCatalog`](samples/ORKCatalog) sample app is a good place to start. Find the
project in ResearchKit's [`samples`](samples) directory. This project includes a list of all the
types of steps supported by the *ResearchKit framework* in the first tab, and displays a browser for the
results of the last completed task in the second tab. The third tab shows some examples from the *Charts module*.
