ResearchKit Framework
===========

> [!NOTE]  
> This repository is a [StanfordBDHG](https://github.com/StanfordBDHG) fork of the [ResearchKit project](https://github.com/ResearchKit/ResearchKit) by Apple, adding support for:
> - The [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager/) by building ResearchKit to an [XCFramework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/creating-a-multi-platform-binary-framework-bundle) via GitHub Actions and exposing the built XCFramework as a SPM binary target to speed up build times of projects / packages consuming our ResearchKit fork.
> - SwiftUI support to easily interact with the `ORKTaskViewController` using the [`ORKOrderedTaskView`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/stanfordbdhg/researchkit/documentation/researchkitswiftui/orkorderedtaskview).
> - Building ResearchKit with enabled [Swift's C++ Interoperability](https://www.swift.org/documentation/cxx-interop/), requiring minor code adjustments (not additive) to the ResearchKit codebase.
> - Building ResearchKit natively on [visionOS to run on Apple Vision Pro](https://developer.apple.com/visionos/).

### Installation<a name="installation"></a>

Follow the article about [Adding Package Dependencies to Your App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app) using the following repository URL: `https://github.com/StanfordBDHG/ResearchKit`.

### ORKCatalog App <a name="orkcatalog-app"></a>

The included catalog app demonstrates the different modules that are available in *ResearchKit*. Find the
project in ResearchKit's [`samples`](samples) directory.

# Surveys <a name="surveys"></a>

The *ResearchKit framework* provides a pre-built user interface for surveys, which can be presented
modally on an *iPhone* or *iPad*. The example below shows the process to present a height question for a participant to answer.

```swift
import ResearchKit
import ResearchKitUI
    
let sectionHeaderFormItem = ORKFormItem(sectionTitle: "Your question here.")

let heightQuestionFormItem = ORKFormItem(identifier: "heightQuestionFormItem1", text: nil, answerFormat: ORKAnswerFormat.heightAnswerFormat())
heightQuestionFormItem.placeholder = "Tap here"

let formStep = ORKFormStep(identifier: "HeightQuestionIdentifier", title: "Height", text: "Local system")
formStep.formItems = [sectionHeaderFormItem, heightQuestionFormItem]

return formStep
```

The height question is presented in the figure below.

# Consent <a name="consent"></a>

The *ResearchKit framework* provides classes that you can customize to explain the
details of your research study and obtain a signature if needed. Use *ResearchKit's* provided classes to quickly welcome, and inform your participants of what the study entails.

```swift
import ResearchKit
import ResearchKitUI

// Welcome page.
let welcomeStep = ORKInstructionStep(identifier: String(describing: Identifier.consentWelcomeInstructionStep))
welcomeStep.iconImage = UIImage(systemName: "hand.wave")
welcomeStep.title = "Welcome!"
welcomeStep.detailText = "Thank you for joining our study. Tap Next to learn more before signing up."
        
// Before You Join page.
let beforeYouJoinStep = ORKInstructionStep(identifier: String(describing: Identifier.informedConsentInstructionStep))
beforeYouJoinStep.iconImage = UIImage(systemName: "doc.text.magnifyingglass")
beforeYouJoinStep.title = "Before You Join"
        
let sharingHealthDataBodyItem = ORKBodyItem(text: "The study will ask you to share some of your Health data.",
                                            detailText: nil,
                                            image: UIImage(systemName: "heart.fill"),
                                            learnMoreItem: nil,
                                            bodyItemStyle: .image)
        
let completingTasksBodyItem = ORKBodyItem(text: "You will be asked to complete various tasks over the duration of the study.",
                                          detailText: nil,
                                          image: UIImage(systemName: "checkmark.circle.fill"),
                                          learnMoreItem: nil,
                                          bodyItemStyle: .image)
        
let signatureBodyItem = ORKBodyItem(text: "Before joining, we will ask you to sign an informed consent document.",
                                    detailText: nil,
                                    image: UIImage(systemName: "signature"),
                                    learnMoreItem: nil,
                                    bodyItemStyle: .image)
        
let secureDataBodyItem = ORKBodyItem(text: "Your data is kept private and secure.",
                                     detailText: nil,
                                     image: UIImage(systemName: "lock.fill"),
                                     learnMoreItem: nil,
                                     bodyItemStyle: .image)
        
beforeYouJoinStep.bodyItems = [
    sharingHealthDataBodyItem,
    completingTasksBodyItem,
    signatureBodyItem,
    secureDataBodyItem
]
```
The consent steps are presented in the figure below.

Vist the `Obtaining Consent`article in ResearchKit's Documentation for
more examples that include signature collection and PDF file storage.

# Active Tasks <a name="active-tasks"></a>

Some studies may need data beyond survey questions or the passive data collection capabilities
available through use of the *HealthKit* and *CoreMotion* APIs if you are programming for *iOS*.
*ResearchKit*'s active tasks invite users to perform activities under semi-controlled conditions,
while *iPhone* sensors actively collect data.
ResearchKit active tasks are not diagnostic tools nor medical devices of any kind and output from those active tasks may not be used for diagnosis. Developers and researchers are responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to further development and use of the active tasks.

Use predefined tasks provided by *ResearchKit* to guide your participants through specific actions.

```swift
import ResearchKit
import ResearchKitUI
import ResearchKitActiveTask

let orderedTask = ORKOrderedTask.dBHLToneAudiometryTask(withIdentifier: "dBHLToneAudiometryTaskIdentifier",
							intendedUseDescription: nil, options: [])
							
let taskViewController = ORKTaskViewController(task: orderedTask, taskRun: nil)
taskViewController.delegate = self

present(taskViewController, animated: true)
```
The dBHL Tone Audiometry task is presented in the figure below.
