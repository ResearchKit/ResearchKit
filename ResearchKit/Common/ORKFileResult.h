/**
 The `ORKFileResult` class is a result that references the location of a file produced
 during a task.
 
 A file result is typically generated by the framework as the task proceeds. When the task
 completes, it may be appropriate to serialize the linked file for transmission
 to the server.
 
 Active steps typically produce file results when CoreMotion or HealthKit are
 serialized to disk using a data logger (`ORKDataLogger`). Audio recording also produces a file
 result.
 
 When you write a custom step, use files to report results only when the data
 is likely to be too big to hold in memory for the duration of the task. For
 example, fitness tasks that use sensors can be quite long and can generate
 a large number of samples. To compensate for the length of the task, you can stream the samples to disk during
 the task, and return an `ORKFileResult` object in the result hierarchy, usually as a
 child of an `ORKStepResult` object.

 It is the responsibility of the receiver of the result object to delete
 the file when it is no longer needed.
 
 The file is typically written to the output directory of the
 task view controller, so it is common to manage the archiving or cleanup
 of these files by archiving or deleting the entire output directory.
