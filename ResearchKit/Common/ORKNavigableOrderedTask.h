@class ORKStepNavigationRule;

/**
 The `ORKNavigableOrderedTask` class adds conditional step navigation to the behavior inherited from
 `ORKOrderedTask`.
 
 For implementing conditional task navigation, you must instantiate concrete subclasses of
 `ORKStepNavigationRule` and attach them to trigger steps by using
 `setNavigationRule:forTriggerStepIdentifier:`.
 
 For example, if you want to display a survey question only when the user answered Yes to a previous
 question you can use `ORKPredicateStepNavigationRule`; or if you want to define an arbitrary jump
 between two steps you can use `ORKDirectStepNavigationRule`.
 
 Navigable ordered tasks support looping over previously visited steps. Note, however, that results
 for steps that are visited more than once will be ovewritten when you revisit the step on the loop.
 Thus, going over a loop will produce duplicate results within the task results for the steps that
 are seen more than once, but all the duplicate step results will point to the same result instance:
 the one corresponding to the last time you visited the step.
 
 The same applies when navigating backwards over looped steps: only your last valid answer is shown
 every time you encounter a revisited step.
