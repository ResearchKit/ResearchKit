/**
 The `ORKNavigableOrderedTask` class adds conditional step navigation to the behavior inherited from
 the `ORKOrderedTask` class.
 
 For implementing conditional task navigation, you must instantiate concrete subclasses of
 `ORKStepNavigationRule` and `ORKSkipStepNavigationRule` and attach them to trigger steps by using
 the `setNavigationRule:forTriggerStepIdentifier:` and `setSkipNavigationRule:forStepIdentifier:`
 methods.
 
 For example, if you want to display a survey question only when the user answered Yes to a previous
 question you can use `ORKPredicateStepNavigationRule`; or if you want to define an arbitrary jump
 between two steps you can use `ORKDirectStepNavigationRule`. You can also optionally omit steps by
 using `ORKPredicateSkipStepNavigationRule` objects.
 
 Note that each step in the task can have at most one attached navigation rule and one attached skip
 navigation rule.
 
 Navigable ordered tasks support looping over previously visited steps. Note, however, that results
 for steps that are visited more than once will be ovewritten when you revisit the step on the loop.
 Thus, going over a loop will produce duplicate results within the task results for the steps that
 are seen more than once, but all the duplicate step results will point to the same result instance:
 the one corresponding to the last time you visited the step.
 
 The same applies when navigating backwards over looped steps: only your last valid answer is shown
 every time you encounter a revisited step.
