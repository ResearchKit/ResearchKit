/**
 The `ORKNavigableOrderedTask` class adds conditional step navigation to the behavior inherited from
 `ORKOrderedTask`.
 
 For implementing conditional task navigation, you must instantiate concrete subclasses of
 `ORKStepNavigationRule` and attach them to trigger steps by using
 `setNavigationRule:forTriggerStepIdentifier:`.
 
 For example, if you want to display a survey question only when the user answered Yes to a previous
 question you can use `ORKPredicateStepNavigationRule`; or if you want to define an arbitrary jump
 between two steps you can use `ORKDirectStepNavigationRule`.
