/**
 The `ORKOrderedTask` class implements all the methods in the `ORKTask` protocol and represents a 
 task that assumes a fixed order for its steps.
 
 In the ResearchKit framework, any simple sequential task, such as a survey or an active task, can
 be represented as an ordered task.
 
 If you want further custom conditional behaviors in a task, it can be easier to subclass
 `ORKOrderedTask` or `ORKNavigableOrderedTask` and override particular `ORKTask` methods than it is
 to implement the `ORKTask` protocol directly. Override the methods `stepAfterStep:withResult:` and
 `stepBeforeStep:withResult:`, and call super for all other methods.

 Returns a predefined task that tests spatial span memory.
 
 In a spatial span memory task, the participant is asked to repeat pattern sequences of increasing
 length in a game-like environment. You can use this task to assess visuospatial memory and
 executive function.

 
 In each round of the task, an array of
 target images are shown in a grid (by default, the images are flowers). The round consists of a
 demonstration phase and an interactive phase. In the demonstration phase, some of the flowers
 change color in a specific sequence. After the demonstration, the user is asked to tap the flowers
 in the same sequence for the interactive phase.
 
 The span (that is, the length of the pattern sequence) is automatically varied during the task,
 increasing after users succeed and decreasing after they fail, within the range specified by
 minimum and maximum values that you specify. You can also customize the speed of sequence playback
 and the shape of the tap target.

/**
 Returns a predefined task that tests the participant's reaction time.
 
 In a reaction time task, the participant is asked to move the device sharply in any
 direction in response to a visual cue. You can use this task to accurately assess the participant's
 simple reaction time.
 
 A reaction time task finishes when the participant has completed the required
 number of attempts successfully. An attempt is successful when the participant exerts acceleration
 greater than `thresholdAcceleration` to the device after the stimulus has been delivered and before
 `timeout` has elapsed. An attempt is unsuccessful if acceleration greater than
 `thresholdAcceleration` is applied to the device before the stimulus or if this does not occur
 before `timeout` has elapsed. If unsuccessful, the result is not reported and the participant must
 try again to proceed with the task.
 
 Data collected by the task is in the form of ORKReactionTimeResult objects. These
 objects contain a timestamp representing the delivery of the stimulus and an ORKFileResult, which
 references the motion data collected during an attempt. The researcher can use these to evaluate
 the response to the stimulus and calculate the reaction time.
 
 @param identifier                  The task identifier to use for this task, appropriate to the
                                        study.

                                        default localized text is displayed.
 @param maximumStimulusInterval     The maximum interval before the stimulus is delivered.
 @param minimumStimulusInterval     The minimum interval before the stimulus is delivered.
 @param thresholdAcceleration       The acceleration required to end a reaction time test.
 @param numberOfAttempts            The number of successful attempts required before the task is
                                        complete. The active step result will contain this many
                                        child results if the task is completed.
 @param timeout                     The interval permitted after the stimulus until the test fails,
                                        if the threshold is not reached.
 @param successSoundID              The sound to play after a successful attempt.
 @param timeoutSoundID              The sound to play after an attempt that times out.
