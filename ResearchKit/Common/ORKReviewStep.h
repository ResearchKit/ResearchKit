/**
 The `ORKReviewStep` class is a concrete subclass of `ORKStep` that represents
 a step in which existing question results can be reviewed by the user.
 
 There are two separate scenarios for using `ORKReviewStep`. The first one is to embed a review step within an ongoing 
 survey, which means an instance of `ORKReviewStep` might be placed at the end or in the middle of a task. The second 
 scenario is meant to use `ORKReviewStep` standalone for reviewing an already completed task.
 
 To use a review step, instantiate an `ORKReviewStep` object, fill in its properties, and include it in a task. Next, 
 create a task view controller for the task and present it.
 
 When a task view controller presents an `ORKReviewStep` object, it instantiates an `ORKReviewStepViewController` object 
 to present the step. This view controller lists both steps and step results to provide all entered data at a glance. It
 also allows the user to navigate directly to a certain step. However, results may only be changed from there, if the 
 review step is used within an ongoing survey (`embedded`).
