/**
 The base object for composing a task.
 
 ``ORKStep`` is the base class for the steps that can compose a task for presentation
 in an ``ORKTaskViewController`` object. Each ``ORKStep`` object represents one logical piece of data
 entry or activity in a larger task.
 
 A step can be a question, an active test, or a simple instruction. Pair an ``ORKStep``
 subclass with an ``ORKStepViewController`` subclass to display the step.
 
 To use a step, instantiate an ``ORKStep`` object and populate its properties. Add the step to a task,
 such as an ``ORKOrderedTask`` object, then present the task using ``ORKTaskViewController``.
 
 To implement a new type of step, subclass ``ORKStep`` and add your additional
 properties.Then subclass ``ORKStepViewController`` and implement
 your user interface. If your step is timed, or requires sensor data collection,
 subclass ``ORKActiveStep`` and ``ORKActiveStepViewController``.
