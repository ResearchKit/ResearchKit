 one or more result predicates (each predicate can match one or more step results within the task).
 
 Predicate step navigation rules contain an arbitrary number of result predicates with a
 corresponding number of destination step identifiers, plus an optional default step identifier that
 is used if none of the result predicates match. One result predicate can match one or more question
 results; if matching several question results, that predicate can belong to the same or to
 different task results). This rule allows you to define arbitrarily complex task navigation
 behaviors.
 
 The `ORKResultPredicate` class provides convenience class methods to build predicates for all the
 `ORKQuestionResult` subtypes. Predicates must supply both the task result identifier and the
 question result identifier, in addition to one or more expected answers.
