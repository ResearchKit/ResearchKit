/**
 The `ORKTableStepViewController` class is an base class that inherits from `ORKStepViewController` 
 and provides a UITableView.
 
 `ORKTableStepViewController` is designed to take advantage of the internal class methods 
 used by `ORKFormStepViewController`, `ORKQuestionStepViewController` and `ORKReviewStepViewController` 
 to allow for a consistent UI in a custom implementation of a main view that is a UITableView.
 
 This will class will setup a consistent look for the title, text, learn more, skip and next UI elements
 that are used by these classes as well as most of the other view controllers within this framework by 
 automatically adding them as the header and footer of the tableview.
 
 The base class implementation REQUIRES using an `ORKTableStep` as its data source. If you do not inherit 
 the step from ORKTableStep, then subclasses MUST override `-cellForRowAtIndexPath`.
