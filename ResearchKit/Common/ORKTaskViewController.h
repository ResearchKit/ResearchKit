/**
 The `ORKTaskViewController` class is the primary entry point for the presentation of the
 ResearchKit framework UI. Note that a task view controller usually presents an `ORKOrderedTask` instance, but it can present any object that implements `ORKTask`.
 
 The task view controller is intended for modal presentation, which lets the user cancel participation in the task at any time. Typically, the task view
 controller displays a navigation bar and conducts right-to-left
 navigation for each step as the user progresses through the task.
 
 The task view controller supports UI state restoration, which allows users to continue a long task when they resume your app. To enable state restoration, set the restoration
 identifier and take the appropriate action to restore the task view controller when your app restarts or resumes.
 
 The task view controller also lets users save their progress in the middle of a task. To support
 this scenario in your app, implement `[ORKTaskViewControllerDelegate taskViewControllerSupportsSaveAndRestore:]` in your
 task view controller delegate, and return `YES`. If the task completes with the
 status `ORKTaskViewControllerFinishReasonSaved`, copy and store the value of the
 `restorationData` property. When the user resumes the task, create a
 new task view controller using the `initWithTask:restorationData:` initializer,
 and present it.
 
 It is possible to configure the task view controller to prefill surveys with
 data from another source, such as a previous run of the same task.
 Set the `defaultResultSource` property to use this feature.

 When conducting active tasks which may produce file results, always set the
 `outputDirectory` property. Files generated during active steps are written to
 the output directory that you specify, and references to these files are returned by `ORKFileResult`
 objects in the result hierarchy.
