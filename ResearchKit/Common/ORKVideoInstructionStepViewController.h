/**
 An `ORKVideoInstructionStepViewController` object is the view controller for an `ORKVideoInstructionStep` object.
 
 In general, you don't need to instantiate an video instruction step view controller directly.
 Instead, add an video instruction step to a task and present the task using a
 task view controller. When appropriate, the task view controller instantiates the step
 view controller for the step.
