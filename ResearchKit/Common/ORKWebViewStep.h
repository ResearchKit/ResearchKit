/**
 The `ORKWebViewStep` class represents a step that displays an embedded webview.
 
 This may be useful in cases where extreme custom styling is necessary, or an instrument
 with specific requirements does not yet have a native implementation.
 
 In order to proceed to the next step from inside the webviewstep, you must execute this
 line of javascript when the user should proceed:
 
 window.webkit.messageHandlers.ResearchKit.postMessage(answer);
 
 Where "answer" is the string answer that will be captured in the WebViewStepResult.
 A string answer is required or the user will be unable to proceed.
