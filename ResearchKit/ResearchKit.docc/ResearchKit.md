# ``ResearchKit``

Create apps that securely collect information for research.

## Overview

ResearchKit is open source software for developers and researchers that
leverages iPhone sensors and capabilities to track movement, take measurements, and
record data. People can perform activities and generate data from anywhere.

There are three customizable components that address
common elements of research: *consent*, *surveys*, and *active tasks*. You can use these components as they
are, build on them, and even create completely new components of your own. Whether your app is obtaining consent, giving instructions, or presenting a
form or survey, every task in ResearchKit is a collection of steps.

Consent provides customizable templates that explain study details and
obtain participant consent. Clarifying exactly what information you collect from people, and who
can access that information is crucial to help protect participant privacy.

Surveys have a predefined user interface so you can quickly build screens with
questions and types of answers. The survey component is localized, so you just need
to support localization for your questions.

Active tasks invite people to perform activities in their own environment using
iPhone sensors to actively collect data. This is important for studies that require the data-collection
capabilities of frameworks such as HealthKit and CoreMotion.
