# Steps, tasks, and results

Design and create research-centered apps that guide the participant.

## Overview 

In ResearchKit, you collect information by having participants complete a *task* such as walking or listening to audio. To complete a task, participants perform a series of discrete *steps*. You can build a task to perform the same steps over and over, or change steps dynamically so a previous result informs what appears next. You collect data from tasks using *results*. A result can represent how the task was performed, or whether the participant successfuly completed it.
