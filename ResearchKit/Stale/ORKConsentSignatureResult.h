 A result object from the consent review step.

 The consent signature result is typically found as a child result of the
 `ORKStepResult` object for the consent review step.
 
 You can apply the result to a document to facilitate the generation of a
 PDF including the signature, or for presentation in a follow-on
 consent review.
 
 A consent signature result is typically generated by the framework as the task proceeds. When the task
 completes, it may be appropriate to serialize it for transmission to a server,
 or to immediately perform analysis on it.
