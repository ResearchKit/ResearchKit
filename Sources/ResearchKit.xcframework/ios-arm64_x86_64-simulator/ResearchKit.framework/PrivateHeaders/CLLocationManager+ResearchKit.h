@interface CLLocationManager (ResearchKit)

/**
 These categories on CLLocationManager provide ResearchKit code with a common way of requesting authorization that can be disabled by
 an Xcode build setting. Callers don't have to add compile-time conditional #if blocks. Instead callers should interpret return value of YES to mean
 the authorization request was made, and NO to mean the ResearchKit binary was built with CLLocationManager authorization request calls
 compiled out.
 
 The impetus for this approach was to prevent apps using ResearchKit, but not ResearchKit's CoreLocation-powered features, from needlessly
 defining an NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription Info.plist entry to silence build errors.
